  This website is also an instance of hypertext. Unlike most hypertexts it also makes
  explicit use of <b>transclusion</b>, the core feature of Ted Nelson's original hypertext
  design:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Diagrams are generated from data queried via SPARQL queries from Wikidata
      and transcluded via an HTML iframe from the Wikidata Query Service.
      One could describe the queries as kinds of <b>edit decision lists</b>. 
    </li>
    <li>
      HTML section (such as the one you are reading) are transcluded via JavaScript
      from individual files.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Use the SPARQL and/or HTML link at the right upper corner to get to
  the sources.
